# MARS
Utilising the City, University of London game engine, i created a 2D platformer about an astonaut trying to escape mars!

Features include:
- Save/Load System
- Level Editor with saving/loading (have the ability to create completely new custom levels)
- Enemies
- Score System
- Player Health System
- Powerups
- Additional Movement Mechanics: double jumping, dashing. Mechanics were inspired by Celeste.

This was created in a couple of months as part of my Programming in Java course.
